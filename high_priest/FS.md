[All Skills, all the time](https://skillsim.irowiki.org/hpr.html?10gXdqsXdKhEbqkOqnkbInafbAJy)

Drops magnificat (lvl 3) and Meditatio (lvl 6) in exchange for 3 gloria + 10 signum.Decent all around build for most runs if gloria might be needed.

[Signum only, SP Battery](https://skillsim.irowiki.org/hpr.html?10dKdqsXdKhFbnnbqnqBInafcAJy)

Max signum, no gloria, but max magnificat and meditatio - no more running out of SP, stronger heals.

[Gloria only, SP Battery](https://skillsim.irowiki.org/hpr.html?10nxdnsXdAhFbsroqnqBInafcAJy)

Max gloria, no signum. This isn't terribly recommended, since it only goes from 20s to 30s for gloria, which is already only for specific crit situations. Might be useful if you know you're going auto-attack snipers (GMC Seiren, GMC Saen), or with crit sinx or stargladiators.

### Required

  - Halves all damage. Maxed because longer duration = longer champ can be away from party. Really, tell your champ if you're not on lvl 5.
- Safety Wall 10
  - Blocks all short range attacks for X hits.
