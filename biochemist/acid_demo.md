## Skills

[calc build 1 (FCP lvl 4)](https://skillsim.irowiki.org/bio.html?10JbGKAfrFqnrFsRGAak)

*Tradeoff* The 2 main skills are Acid Demonstation and Full Chemical Protection. Another useful skill is Aid Condensed Potion, which can throw condensed yellows at level 9 or condensed whites at level 10. However, level 10 is only possible if you give up 1 point in the other main skills. I choose to give up FCP because they're relatively cheap so the extra duration isn't the end of the world, and it makes aid condensed easier to use since it's easier to buy white pots than yellows.

Note that the alchemist rank doesn't matter for aid condensed, so if you have cheaper unranked they should be saved for that.
