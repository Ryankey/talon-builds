Prof notes

General notes
	Each floor priority
		Dispel champ
		Put down the correct land

	After mobbed/tanked
		Wall of Fog
		Monster Property

	Regular battle
		Dispel
		Watch for moments to Soul Break for EQ
		Keep up Wall of Fog
		Near mid/end, give champ sp


Questions
	Wall of Fog
		1 cell on champ, to avoid monster getting the effect and causing our snipers to miss (our snipers don't seem to be affected in pvp or against balls...)
		Still confused on the "ranged skills go through it" - Does this mean that the WoF needs to be 1 cell on champ, not on the monsters, and not in the path of the snipers? (this seems to not apply, very confused by the wording)
	Volcano default
		I always understood this to be because most snipers are wearing fire armor by default, which gives them a dmg boost. - Confirmed
