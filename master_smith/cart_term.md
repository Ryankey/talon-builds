## SQI Cards + Bonuses

Likely want to have Doppel with some combo of incantaction samurai (+65 ATK) or tendrillion (+45 ATK, +35 HIT)

Want

* Spend 75% less zeny with all Zeny Skills.
* [Over-Thrust] won't break party member weapons. Enable [Full Adrenaline Rush] without [Blacksmith Spirit].
* For each mastered Forge Passive add ATK + 10 and DEF Pierce + 2%; but reduce HP Leech Script total amount by 50%.
* Reduce [Cart Termination] and [Mammonite] SP costs by 50%
** Spamming > constant drain

Other Options

* Assume max weight for [Cart Revolution] and [Cart Termination] regardless of cart weight.
** This is nice, but it's not a hard blocker - bring 4k meat and use the 8k personal weight for storage. We don't have a lot of lootable instances
* Enable [Weapon Perfection] and [Power Maximize] effects all the time with no SP costs when these skills are mastered.
** Another nice SP option but like... meh SP
